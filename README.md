# Hands-On Data Preprocessing in Python

<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-data-preprocessing-in-python/9781801072137"><img src="https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781801072137/cover/smaller" alt="Hands-On Data Preprocessing in Python" height="256px" align="right"></a>

This is the code repository for [Hands-On Data Preprocessing in Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/hands-on-data-preprocessing-in-python/9781801072137), published by Packt.

**Learn how to effectively prepare data for successful data analytics**

## What is this book about?
Data preprocessing is the first step in data visualization, data analytics, and machine learning, where data is prepared for analytics functions to get the best possible insights. Around 90% of the time spent on data analytics, data visualization, and machine learning projects is dedicated to performing data preprocessing.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Use Python to perform analytics functions on your data
* Understand the role of databases and how to effectively pull data from databases
* Perform data preprocessing steps defined by your analytics goals
* Recognize and resolve data integration challenges
* Identify the need for data reduction and execute it

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
from ipywidgets import interact, widgets
interact(plotyear,year=widgets.
IntSlider(min=2010,max=2019,step=1,value=2010))
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Junior and senior data analysts, business intelligence professionals, engineering undergraduates, and data enthusiasts looking to perform preprocessing and data cleaning on large amounts of data will find this book useful. Basic programming skills, such as working with variables, conditionals, and loops, along with beginner-level knowledge of Python and simple analytics experience, are assumed.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-18).

### Software and Hardware List

| Chapter  | Software required                   | OS required                        |

## Errata

**Chapter 5 - page 126:** The code chunk under Chapter 5 Data Visualization, Subsection Example of comparing populations using boxplots (page 126) is misplaced. The correct chunk of code can be found on the dedicated GitHub of the book. Also, this is the correct code:

```
income_possibilities = adult_df.income.unique()
dataForBox_dic= {}
for poss in income_possibilities:
    BM = adult_df.income == poss
    dataForBox_dic[poss] = adult_df[BM]['education-num']
    
plt.boxplot(dataForBox_dic.values(),vert=False)
plt.yticks([1,2],income_possibilities)
plt.show()
```

**Chapter 6 - page 166:** The following code chunk which can be found in Chapter 6, Prediction, Example of applying linear regression to perform regression analysis (page 166) has an error.

```
X = ['P_Football_Performance','P_2SMA']
Y = 'N_Applications'
```

The correct chunk of code:

```
X = ['P_Football_Performance','SMAn2']
Y = 'N_Applications'
```

The code in the GitHub repository is correct.

**Chapter 12 - page 380:** The first sentence in Exercise 5 of Chapter 12 (page 380) should be:

‚ÄúRecreate Figure 5.23 from Chapter 5, Data Visualization, but instead of using WH Report_preprocessed.csv, integrate the following three files yourself first: WH Report.csv, populations.csv, and Countries.csv.‚Äù

Instead of 

‚ÄúRecreate Figure 5.20 from Chapter 5, Data Visualization, but instead of using WH Report_preprocessed.csv, integrate the following three files yourself first: WH Report.csv, populations.csv, and Countries.csv.‚Äù
