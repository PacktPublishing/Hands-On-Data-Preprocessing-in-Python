    "In this example, we will be using **new_train.csv** from https://www.kaggle.com/rashmiranu/banking-dataset-classification. Each row of the data contains customer information along with campaign efforts regarding each customer to get them to subscribe for a long-term deposit at the bank. In this example, we would like to tune a decision tree that can show us the trends that leads to successful subscription campaigning. As the only tuning process we know will be computationally very expensive, we have decided to perform one of the numerosity data reductions we’ve learned in this chapter to ease the computation for the tuning process. Which method would fit this data better? Why? Once you arrived at the data reduction method you want to use, apply the method, tune the decision tree and draw the final decision tree. In the end, comment on a few interesting patterns you found on the final decision tree. "

    "Figure 13.7 shows the result of dimension reduction for the task of predicting the next day’s Amazon Stock Price using Linear Regression. Perform the dimension reduction using the Decision Tree and compare the results. Don’t forget, to do so, you would first need to tune the DecisionTreeRegressor() from sklearn.tree. You may use the following code for tuning."
